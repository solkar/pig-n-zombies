Pig'N'Zombies
by Karlos Zafra
=============

Pig'N'Zombies (PnZ) is a platform game developed with CraftyJs engine. The gameplay is "inspired" in Canabalt (by Adam Atomic & Danny Baranowsky). The purpose of this project is to develop my skills as game designer and programmer. Advice, comment and/or hatemail is welcome.
